# **Diabetes Predictor: Harnessing Neural Networks for Accurate Diagnosis**

Welcome to DeepHealth, where cutting-edge artificial neural networks meet the challenge of accurate diabetes prediction. In this repository, we present a diabetes classification model built on the power of neural networks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we've created a model capable of precisely diagnosing diabetes based on comprehensive patient data.

## Project Overview
Our primary goal is to develop an intelligent system capable of accurately predicting diabetes by analyzing various health-related features. The model employs artificial neural networks to discern intricate patterns and relationships within the dataset, offering a sophisticated approach to diabetes diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn

## Access the Dataset
